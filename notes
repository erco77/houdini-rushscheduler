    * During "Generate Node (static)":
        --- onStartCook [pdg_rushscheduler1]
        --- onStopCook [completed normally]
        --- onTick

      Those are the only items called back.
      Either one of these controls the "dots" vs "pie chart",
      or that's configured somewhere else..

TODO:
        > Must remove Autodump UI option:
              There's no way "done" or "donefail" can be used,
              as the initial frameless job autodumps immediately..!
              The only dump feature is to dump on each restart.
              Also, should dump if the scheduler is removed (like on close of houdini)
              Try to incercept the class destructor.

          doesn't get assigned.

          We'd need to put all Que frames on pause. onTick() would need to keep running,
          perhaps checking work_items to see if they've been paused.
          Need some way to sync rush <-> work_items when Pause is hit

        work_item.hasFrame
        work_Item.frame

        (DONE) Check dependency stuff
        (DONE) Slow the onTick() speed, or control from UI

Questions:
        > Tasks -> Pause current cook: how to resume??
        (DONE) How to access the render logs? (getLogURI() is now being set, but how to access?)
        (DONE) Access new UI elements (Cpus, autodump options, verbose, etc)
        (DONE) "dots" vs pie chart: control?
