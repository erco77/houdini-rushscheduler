    * During "Generate Node (static)":
	--- onStartCook [pdg_rushscheduler1]
	--- onStopCook [completed normally]
	--- onTick

      Those are the only items called back.
      Either one of these controls the "dots" vs "pie chart",
      or that's configured somewhere else..

TODO:
	> Slow the onTick() speed, or control from UI
	> Add verbose option to Jon's UI so we can tune down the tty noise
	> Check dependency stuff
	> How to catch pause (seems there should be an "onPause()/onResume()" callback?)
	  We'd need to put all Que frames on pause. onTick() would need to keep running,
	  perhaps checking work_items to see if they've been paused.
	  Need some way to sync rush <-> work_items when Pause is hit


Questions:
	> Tasks -> Pause current cook: how to resume??
	> "dots" vs pie chart: control?
	> Access new UI elements (Cpus, autodump options, verbose, etc)
	> How to access the render logs? (getLogURI() is now being set, but how to access?)
